                <p>
                    I'm a Master's student in Industrial &amp; Systems Engineering at
                    the University of Wisconsin–Madison, specializing in machine
                    learning, stochastic modeling, and optimization.

                <p>
                    I like taking messy, high-dimensional problems and turning them
                    into <strong>end-to-end ML systems</strong>: neural networks that
                    model calibrated probabilities, optimization models that reason
                    under uncertainty, and pipelines that are easy to debug and
                    iterate on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My current research centers on <strong>probabilistic outcome
                    modeling</strong> using both a standard feed-forward neural
                    network and a Bayesian neural network. The goal is to understand
                    how architecture choice affects accuracy, stability of training,
                    and the quality of predicted probability distributions.

                <p>
                    Ongoing research project on probabilistic outcome modeling using
                    two architectures: a standard feed-forward neural network and a
                    Bayesian neural network. The pipeline ingests historical data,
                    team-strength style signals, and engineered context features to
                    produce calibrated class probabilities instead of just hard labels.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size:0.9rem; color:#a9acb9;">
                    The Bayesian model exhibits smoother training accuracy and loss
                    curves and yields more stable probability distributions compared
                    with the deterministic network. This makes it better suited for
                    simulations, scenario analysis, and risk-aware decision rules
                    where the full predictive distribution matters.

                <h3>Context-Aware Outcome Modeling with News, Weather &amp; CTMC Dynamics</h3>
                <p>
                    Planned extension of my current outcome-model pipeline that
                    incorporates external context (news, reports, and weather) and
                    explicit time evolution. The idea is to use a continuous-time
                    Markov chain (CTMC) style representation to track how match
                    conditions evolve over time while injecting structured signals
                    from text and weather data.

                    This phase will compare models trained on core structured features
                    vs models augmented with context signals, measuring how much
                    news- and weather-derived features improve calibration, sharpness,
                    and stability of probabilities over multi-step horizons.

                <p>
                    Longer-term idea to build a simulation framework where multiple
                    agents interact in simple environments (social dilemmas,
                    predator–prey, resource harvesting, trading, etc.). Each agent
                    observes partial state, chooses actions via a policy network, and
                    uses a Bayesian head to model uncertainty over returns.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size:0.9rem; color:#a9acb9;">
                    The goal is to combine a deterministic policy (SNN + policy
                    gradient updates) with a Bayesian neural network head that
                    propagates uncertainty through multi-step rollouts, and then study
                    how uncertainty-aware policies differ from standard RL in terms of
                    stability, cooperation, and behavior in noisy environments.

                <p>
                    Concept for a lightweight “guardrail model” that predicts how a
                    large language model is likely to respond before the full answer
                    is generated. The focus is on learning patterns of prompts,
                    intermediate tokens, and contexts that correlate with safe vs
                    undesired completions.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size:0.9rem; color:#a9acb9;">
                    The long-term aim is to train predictors over prompt–response
                    pairs that can flag risky wording, suggest safer alternatives, and
                    estimate the probability of policy violations, so LLM applications
                    can route, block, or reshape requests in advance rather than
                    reacting afterwards.

                <h3>Facial Expression Detection (ResNet50–ViT Hybrid)</h3>
                <p>
                    Hybrid ResNet50 + Vision Transformer model for facial expression
                    recognition on low-resolution grayscale images, using transfer
                    learning, augmentation, and cross-validation to improve robustness.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size:0.9rem; color:#a9acb9;">
                    The hybrid architecture improves macro-averaged accuracy over a
                    plain CNN and generalizes better to under-represented emotion
                    classes, showing the benefit of combining convolutional and
                    attention-based features.

                <h3>News + Stock Forecasting &amp; Trading Agent</h3>
                <p>
                    Prototype that merges news-derived embeddings with price history
                    to forecast short-term price moves and drive a simple buy/sell
                    agent. Uses mixture-style outputs to capture multi-modal returns
                    and backtests strategies against basic benchmarks.

                <p style="font-size:0.9rem; color:#a9acb9;">
                    Adding news-based features improves directional hit-rate and
                    backtest performance compared with a price-only baseline, showing
                    how unstructured information can be turned into useful signals for
                    trading decisions.
